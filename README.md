**asyncfiles** is a high-performance async file I/O library for Python, built on top of [libuv](https://libuv.org/) using Cython. It provides true asynchronous file operations without blocking the event loop, offering significant performance improvements over thread-based alternatives.

## 🚀 Features

- **True Async I/O**: Built directly on libuv's async filesystem operations
- **High Performance**: Cython-optimized with zero-copy buffer operations
- **Non-blocking**: No thread pools - pure async I/O all the way down
- **Simple API**: Familiar async context manager interface
- **Type Hints**: Full typing support for better IDE integration
- **Memory Efficient**: Configurable buffer sizes for optimal memory usage

## 📦 Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asyncfiles.git
cd asyncfiles

# Initialize libuv submodule
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build and install
make compile
pip install -e .
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Cython ~3.0
- A C compiler (gcc, clang, or MSVC)
- libuv (included as submodule)


## 🔥 Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from asyncfiles import open

async def main():
    # Read a file
    async with open('example.txt', 'r') as f:
        content = await f.read()
        print(content)
    
    # Write to a file
    async with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
        await f.write('Hello, async world!')

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Reading Files

```python
import asyncio
from asyncfiles import open

async def read_file():
    # Read entire file
    async with open('data.txt', 'r') as f:
        content = await f.read()
        return content

asyncio.run(read_file())
```

### Writing Files

```python
import asyncio
from asyncfiles import open

async def write_file():
    async with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
        await f.write('Line 1\n')
        await f.write('Line 2\n')
        await f.write('Line 3\n')

asyncio.run(write_file())
```

### Custom Buffer Size

```python
import asyncio
from asyncfiles import open

async def large_file():
    # Use 1MB buffer for large files
    async with open('large_file.bin', 'r', buffer_size=1024*1024) as f:
        data = await f.read()
        return data

asyncio.run(large_file())
```

### Multiple Concurrent Operations

```python
import asyncio
from asyncfiles import open

async def process_files():
    # Read multiple files concurrently
    async def read_file(path):
        async with open(path, 'r') as f:
            return await f.read()
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        read_file('file1.txt'),
        read_file('file2.txt'),
        read_file('file3.txt'),
    )
    
    return results

asyncio.run(process_files())
```

## 🎯 Supported File Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `'r'` | Read text (default) |
| `'w'` | Write text (truncate) |
| `'a'` | Append text |
| `'x'` | Exclusive creation |
| `'r+'` | Read and write |
| `'w+'` | Write and read (truncate) |
| `'a+'` | Append and read |

Additional modifiers:
- `'b'`: Binary mode
- `'t'`: Text mode (default)

## ⚡ Performance

asyncfiles significantly outperforms thread-based async file libraries:
